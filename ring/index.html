       <strong><em>Femboys are misrepresented online.</em></strong> There's a common misconception
      that being a femboy is just
      "<a target="_blank" href="https://happymag.tv/femboy/">a trend</a>" or an aesthetic, but it's
      much, much more than that. Being a femboy/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_variance">GNC</a> person means embracing your identity in a world that
      often misunderstands or mocks gender nonconformity. When self-expression is stifled in almost every aspect of life, it's important that we do what we can to establish a community (no matter how small) so that someday in the future the world's grip on gender stereotypes falls away.
   <h2 style="font-size: 30px;" class='title'>The Purpose</h2> <br> 
   <p>
 The true purpose of this website is to inform others about the existance of femboys. Meaning that we are not just following some trend, but that <strong>being a femboy is more than just the skirts and thighhighs. </strong>
